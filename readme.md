# Fire Contol for Games I like

## Mechwarrior is the main game I use there are some gotcha's if you have not use a macro app like this before

- MWO means you will want to have a 50+ ms press time or it will not register.
- Input mode needs to be Event.
- basicly all of the stuff at the header of each file is there to satify a need of MWO.
- I tried to make this some what simple, some mechs i chose to have a spread of weapons over time for optimal heat some times it is just to avoid ghost heat. Also they are based on my builds of these mechs feel free to update and change to your needs.

## Magica

- spells for magica 2 are some times really hard there are some 
- another example of making sure all the nessicary bit are in place for a game.

## Sea of Thieves

- I wanted to ring a bell really fast so ya...
